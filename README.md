# Flashcards - React / Redux practice project

Link to the deployed app here: (link to be added)

This is a project that's part of the Codecademy 'front-end engineer' course. 

Its aim is to practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app.

## What does this app do?

Users are able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards (which hide answers on the other side of the card) for those quizzes, to be used as a revision tool. 

This app has no server side storage. This means a refresh of the browser will result in all stored details being lost. No data storage was set up as this is only intended to be a demonstration of the React and Redux libraries

## What languages are used to make this app?

This app uses the React framework, a Javascript library, to create a 'single page application' (SPA), rendering a single HTML element. CSS is used for styling, and Redux-React / Redux Toolkit is used for 'state management'. 

I used React Router (v5), React-Redux hooks useSelector, useDisptach, and React Toolkit features createSlice, configureStore, and the overall Provider function.  

## Can I access the Codecademy course material?

Yes. Here is the course: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-redux/modules/wdcp-22-flashcards/projects/react-redux-flashcards

You may need to enrol onto one of the courses that includes this project to access it.
